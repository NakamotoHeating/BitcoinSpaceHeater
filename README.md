# SilentBitcoinSpaceHeater

Files and build instructions for the #SilentBitcoinSpaceHeater see https://twitter.com/NakamotoHeating/ to learn more.

## Idea

- Create a space heating solution based on an Antminer S9 which is completely or near silent.
- Reuse existing parts of a stock S9
- Use parts that are easily and widely available or are 3D printed
- Simple and low complex solution. Goal for anybody to build this at home
- Completely Open Source

## Injector Plates

The injector plates are designed by [@Adrian_van_Wijk](https://twitter.com/Adrian_van_Wijk). And freely available under the `stl` and `stp` Folder.
We strongly suggest to print them with ABS, as PLA get malleable (glass transition temperature) at 60C/140F which could cause problems when the Oil gets to 60C+ temperatures.

Experience shows that the threads and pipe of the bottom cover are better printed without support. For this there are `3mf` files attached that have the required support inhibitors and settings for an Ender 3V2 printer with ABS (modify to your needs).
